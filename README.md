## User Story

```md
As a User I am fiercely dedicated to external affirmations and am terribly indecisive.
I would like a site where I can use a generic icosahedron for guidance.
I would like positive affirmations for the days I feel less that 100%
I would like to be insulted to keep my ego in check
I need to be able to vote  and see what other people have voted in order to guide my confirmation bias
